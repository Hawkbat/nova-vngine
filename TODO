Rework steps to use generic args/param/children system like expressions

ParsedStringField fails when the stringified real value doesn't match the temp value but the parsing is still successful
Simplest fix is to only pass parsing on exact match between String(parseFloat(s)) and s
More complicated fix is to pass temp string ref back up to ParsedStringField to make sure it matches
