Rework steps to use generic args/params/children definitions like expressions use

Handle deferred store updates by using setter functions exclusively instead of direct values. Apply each setter immediately but queue up store notifications until the end of the current frame using `setTimeout(cb, 0)`.

Asset handling is tricky. Ideally we want something akin to ref counting where React components request assets via file path/file handle in a hook, automatically rerendering the components when the asset is available (probably via `useSyncExternalStore`), and then the asset can be unloaded when all components using it have expired. We will likely want to delay expiration by a minute or two to avoid thrashing the cache.

We probably don't actually need the Web Audio API for audio; `HTMLAudioElement` is decent, similar to `HTMLImageElement`, and potentially less resource intensive on lower-end devices.
