Preload assets by recursing through the step sequences to find upcoming backdrops, character sprites, etc.

Improve step editors with multi-select and multi-drag, keyboard shortcuts to navigate or delete, etc.

Split entities off from the project file and into separate files, one per entity. The project store can stay as-is but with the files saved and loaded separately at project load and save steps. This will help avoid Git conflicts with multiple concurrent edits.

Add a storage backend that utilizes some form of cloud storage so projects can be shared and edited collaboratively.
