Rework steps to use generic args/params/children definitions like expressions use

Deeply nested step trees are a mess. Maybe we can refactor to store in one long array and have 'end' step markers instead

Handle deferred store updates by deferring calls of the subscription listeners until the end of the current frame using `setTimeout(cb, 0)`. State updates should still happen synchronously, and some listeners may need to be synchronous (like diffing listeners)

Generate and cache thumbnails for images and lazily load audio for 'preview' playback in place of generic icons for those entity types
100x100px thumbnails should be a good size, 100% zoom for a 2em square and 50% zoom for a 1em square
Can use OffscreenCanvas to load and render image and then crop it and export it to image format
Audio truncation is tricker if we want to ever go that route, but should be possible using an OfflineAudioContext and MediaRecorder

Make custom audio player control component
